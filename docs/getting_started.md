## Download & Setup

To use [seq2seq] you need a working installation of Tensorflow with
Python 2.7 or Python 3.5. Follow the [Tensorflow Getting Started](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup)
for detailed setup instructions. With Tensorflow installed, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennybritz/seq2seq.git
cd seq2seq
```

To make sure everything works as expect you can run a simple test case:

```test
./test/train_infer_test.sh
```

If you see a success message you are all set. If you run into setup issues
please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/dennybritz/seq2seq/issues).


## Using a pre-trained model

Training sequence models can take a long time. For example, training a model for
translating from English to German takes several days on a state of the art
GPU.
